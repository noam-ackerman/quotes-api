My Quotes API

here is a URL to my mock API, feel free to use it-
https://my-qoutes-api.herokuapp.com/qoutes

*i usually integrate api in my project and fetch data with axios ( https://github.com/axios/axios )

made this mock API with - https://github.com/typicode/json-server -package! 

In the meanwhile there are only 50 quotes in the data base but I'm planning to add more with time and hopfully to fill it up to hundreds! 

Quotes were chosen carefully by me, quotes by/from philosophers, scientists, artists, authors, movies, songs and books...
 if you have interesting quotes you think i should add email me: Noamle.contact@gmail.com

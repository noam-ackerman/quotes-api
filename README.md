My Quotes API

here is a URL to my mock quotes API, feel free to use it-
https://my-qoutes-api.herokuapp.com/qoutes

*i usually integrate api in my project and fetch data with axios ( https://github.com/axios/axios )

made this mock API with - https://github.com/typicode/json-server -package! and with the help of a tutorial by Ania Kub√≥w.

In the meanwhile there are only 50 quotes in the data base but I'm planning to add more in time and hopefully to fill it up to hundreds!
you can find in the response data and array with objects, each object contains id number, the quote and the name of the source.

Quotes were chosen carefully by me, quotes by/from philosophers, scientists, artists, authors, movies, songs and books...
 if you have interesting quotes you think i should add email me: Noamle.contact@gmail.com
